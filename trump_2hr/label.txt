0|President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world, thank you.
1|We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
2|Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
3|We will face challenges.
4|We will confront hardships.
5|But we will get the job done.
6|Every four years, we gather on these steps.
7|to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
8|And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.
9|They have been magnificent
10|Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
11|Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another.
12|But we are transferring power.
13|and giving it back to you, the people.
14|For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government.
15|While the people have borne the cost.
16|But the people did not share.
17|Politicians prospered, but the jobs left. 
18|And the factories closed.
19|The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country.
20|Their victories have not been your victories. 
21|Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
22|And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital.
23|There was little to celebrate.
24|That all changes starting right here and right now.
25|Because this moment is your moment. 
26|It belongs to everyone gathered here today.
27|And everyone watching.
28|This is your day. 
29|This is your celebration.
30|the United States of America, is your country.
31|Is not which party controls our government.
32|But whether our government is controlled by the people.
33|2017 will be remembered.
34|Became the rulers of this nation again.
35|Everyone is listening to you now.
36|You came by the tens of millions
37|To become part of a historic movement.
38|the likes of which the world has never seen before.
39|At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction.
40|that a nation exist to serve its citizens.
41|Americans want great schools for their children.
42|safe neighborhoods for their families.
43|and good jobs for themselves.
44|These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people.
45|But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exist.
46|Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities,
47|tombstones across the landscape of our nation.
48|an education system flushed with cash.
49|but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
50|That have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
51|This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
52|We are one nation, and their pain is our pain.
53|Their dreams are our dreams.
54|and their success will be our success.
55|We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny.
56|The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
57|For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry.
58|Subsidized the armies of other countries.
59|While allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
60|We defended other nation' s borders while refusing to defend our own.
61|And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas.
62|While America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
63|We've made other countries rich.
64|While the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
65|One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers.
66|The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes.
67|and then redistributed all across the world.
68|But that is the past and now we are looking only to the future.
69|We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power.
70|From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
71|It's going to be only America first.
72|Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
73|We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries.
74|Making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.
75|Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
76|I will fight for you with every breath in my body.
77|And I will never, ever let you down.
78|Winning like never before.
79|We will bring back our jobs.
80|We will bring back our borders.
81|We will bring back our wealth,
82|And we will bring back our dreams.
83|We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.
84|We will get our people off of welfare and back to work rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
85|We will follow two simple rules.
86|Buy American and hire American.
87|We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world.
88|But we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
89|We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone 
90|But rather to let it shine as an example.
91|We will shine for everyone to follow.
92|We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones.
93|And unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism.
94|At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America
95|And through our loyalty to our country.
96|We will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
97|When you open your heart to patriotism.
98|There is no room for prejudice.
99|The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
100|We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreement honestly.
101|When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
102|There should be no fear.
103|We are protected, and we will always be protected.
104|We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement.
105|we will be protected by God.
106|Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.
107|In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
108|We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action.
109|Constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.
110|The time for empty talk is over.
111|Now arrives the hour of action.
112|Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
113|No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
114|We will not fail.
115|Our country will thrive and prosper again.
116|We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space,
117|to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies.
118|A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions.
119|It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget.
120|That whether we are black or brown or white.
121|We all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
122|We all enjoyed the same glorious freedoms.
123|And we all salute the same great American flag.
124|And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska,
125|They look up at the same night sky.
126|They feel their heart with the same dreams.
127|And they are infused with the breath of life by the same Almighty Creator.
128|So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean.
129|You will never be ignored again.
130|Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny.
131|And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
132|Together, we will make America strong again.
133|We will make America wealthy again.
134|We will make America proud again.
135|We will make America safe again.
136|And yes, together, we will make America great again.
137|My fellow Americans, As we approach the final days of the year, it is truly incredible to think of how much we have accomplished on our journey together.
138|Since the election, we have created more than 2 million jobs for hard-working, wonderful families and wonderful Americans.
139|Unemployment is at a 17-year low;
140|the stock market is at an all-time high and continues to go up up up. 
141|We want it to keep going.
142|We've liberated the American economy from the Washington overreach,cutting 22 regulations for every one new regulation.
143|The most in the history of our country by far.
144|And just last week, we delivered a big, beautiful Christmas present to the American people.
145|Congress passed massive tax-cuts for millions of working American families and small businesses and large businesses.
146|And those large businesses in particular, coupled with others are going to create jobs.
147|Our tax plan is focused on the middle class, including a near-doubling of the standard deduction, and a huge increase in the child-tax credit.
148|A typical family of 4, earning 7500 dollars.
149|Will see their tax bill cut in half, one half of what you're paying.
150|And Americans will begin seeing these tax cuts in their paychecks starting in February.
151|In addition, our borders are now strong.
152|We will be building the wall.
153|your second Amendment is safe.
154|we are unlocking America's vast energy resources.
155|We've restored enforcement of immigration laws.
156|taking the fight right to MS-13, and getting them out of the country.
157|And we are working with Congress to end chain migration and the visa lottery program, which is terrible and brings in people that we don't want in our country.
158|I'm very proud of the choice of Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.
159|And we are reshaping the entire judiciary for many decades to come.
160|Congress has authorized funding for our military at near-record levels,
161|so that we can rebuild our full military might after years of dangerous cuts and depletion of our military.
162|We've made historic strides in the fight against the murders terro group, known as ISIS.
163|Today, the coalition to defeat ISIS has recaptured nearly 100%.
164|We're rebuilding our nation, rebuilding our confidence, and rebuilding our standing in the world.
165|Today the entire world can see that America is coming back, and coming back strong.
166|The American people are excited about the future.
167|And the incredible possibilities that await all of us.
168|Optimism is everywhere, enthusiasm is booming.
169|And the thrilling American adventure has never looked brighter.
170|We are facing all challenges with new solutions and we're seizing new opportunities with brimming confidence and boundless resolve.
171|Because of you, your patriotism, your devotion, your love for your family,
172|we will be able to pass on the blessings of American liberty and prosperity to our children and our grandchildren.
173|Together, we're protecting our magnificent heritage, and reaching for glorious destiny.
174|Finally, Melania and I wanna wish every American a very happy new year.
175|Our country is great; our country is strong.
176|We're doing things nobody thought possible.
177|Thank you for giving me the opportunity to help. 
178|God bless you, and God bless America.
179|My fellow Americans.
180|Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis.
181|Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. 
182|We are out of space to hold them.
183|And we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.
184|America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. 
185|It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.
186|Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.
187|Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs.
188|Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone.
189|90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. 
190|More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.
191|In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records.
192|Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country.
193|and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.
194|This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.
195|Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United Statesl,a dramatic increase. 
196|These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.
197|One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. 
198|Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.
199|This is the tragic reality.
200|This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.
201|My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. 
202|It' s a tremendous problem.  
203|Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security. 
204|These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe.  
205|In fact, safer than ever before.
206|The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs.
207|We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space.
208|To process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy. 
209|Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.
210|Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes.
211|So that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.
212|Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security.
213|law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier.
214|At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.  
215|This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. 
216|It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need.  
217|This is just common sense.
218|The border wall would very quickly pay for itself.   
219|The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year.
220|Vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. 
221|The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.
222| Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past.
223|They changed their mind only after I was elected President.
224|Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. 
225|And they have refused to provide our brave border agents.
226|with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.
227|The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only.
228|because Democrats will not fund border security.
229|My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. 
230|But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill.
231|that defends our borders and re-opens the government.
232|This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting.
233|I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow.
234|Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.
235|Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. 
236|Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? 
237|They don' t build walls because they hate the people on the outside. 
238|But because they love the people on the inside. 
239|The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing.
240|and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.
241|America's heart broke the day after Christmas.
242|when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border. 
243|The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.
244|Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. 
245|In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer.
246|In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. 
247|In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States.
248|Over the last several years, I’ve met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen.
249|I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. 
250|So sad.
251|So terrible. 
252|I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls.
253|How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?
254|To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security.
255|Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?
256|I would ask.
257|To every member of Congress.
258|Pass a bill that ends this crisis.
259|To every citizen.
260|Call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.
261|When I took the Oath of Office, I swore to protect our country. 
262|This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. 
263|This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.
264|And that is what I will always do.
265|so help me God.
266|Thank you and goodnight.
267|A new optimism is sweeping our country as we return power from Washington
268|and give it back to the American People, where it belongs.
269|For too long, American workers were forgotten by their government , and I mean totally forgotten.
270|Their interests were pushed aside for global projects
271|and their wealth was taken from their communities and shipped across the world, all across the seas.
272|My Administration has offered a new vision?
273|he well-being of the American citizen and worker will be placed second to none
274|and boy do I mean second to none.
275|Since Day One I have been fighting for the hardworking people of this country
276|and this week we took historic action to continue delivering on that promise.
277|We did so in one of the many proud industrial towns of our nation , Kenosha, Wisconsin?
278|with the men and women of Snap-On, who make American tools for workers around the world?
279|They were there, and they loved what they heard, and they loved what they saw.
280|In Wisconsin, I signed an Executive Order to Buy American and Hire American.
281|I took historic action to ensure that Federal Projects are made with American Goods
282|and to keep American workers and companies from being cheated out of contracts by countries that break the rules
283|?and break every regulation in the book to take advantage of the United States?
284|That' not going to happen anymore.
285|I also took action to reform our immigration system so that it puts the needs of American workers first
286|the duty of government is to represent the citizens of the United States, and that is what we will do.
287|Whether it' removing job-killing regulations, protecting our borders, or unleashing American energy, we are keeping our promises and delivering for the American Worker?
288|During my visit, I talked about how America is a nation that honors work. We honor grit.
289|We honor craftsmanship. We honor the skilled tradespeople who turn rock and steel and iron and cement into works of art and grace and beauty.
290|There' tremendous talent there, believe me.
291|The wrench and ratchet are not only tools, but instruments that help build cities out of deserts and send ships across oceans
292|?And the tools of craftsmen and the masons are just as important as the tools of the doctor and the dentist or the CEO
293|or even the tools of politicians, believe it or not , and their work is every bit as noble?
294|They take pride in their jobs, and we take pride in them.
295|No longer will the concerns of these hardworking Americans go unanswered?
296|By making government answer to our citizens, we are removing the limits on our future and setting free the dreams of our people?
297|As long as we do this, optimism will continue to soar?
298|Hope will continue to spring. And this country we love will grow stronger and stronger day by day.
299|Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless America.
300|I truly believe that the first 100 days of my Administration has been just about the most successful in our country' history.
301|Most importantly, we're bringing back jobs?
302|You asked the people of Michigan; you asked the people of Ohio; you can ask the people of Pennsylvania.See what' happening.
303|See what' happening. See the car companies come roaring back in?
304|They don't want to leave. They want to stay here. They want a piece of the action.
305|Our country is going up and it' going up fast.
306|Our companies are doing better , they just announced fantastic profits , all because of what' happened in this rather short period of time.
307|And that' just the beginning. We're putting in a massive tax cut for the middle class and for business?
308|It' going to have an enormous effect.
309|The massive Keystone Pipeline, the Dakota Pipeline , tens of thousands of jobs right there?
310|And so many other businesses. We're really proud of what we're doing.
311|The F-35 fighter jet program , it was way over budget?
312|I've saved 725 million dollars plus, just by getting involved in the negotiation?
313|We're cutting costs, and we're going to have a truly competitive and great country again.
314|In just fourteen weeks, my administration has brought profound change to Washington.
315|The most fundamental change can be found in the relationship between the people and their government.
316|?For too long, politicians cared more about special interests than they did about a very successful future for all Americans.
317|They took our taxpayers' money, and sent their jobs and wealth to other countries.
318|Not anymore. From the first day of my administration, I have governed by a simple idea: My only allegiance is to you, our wonderful citizens.
319|Together we are seeing that great achievements are possible when we put American People first.
320|That is why I withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership?
321|That day was a turning point for our nation. It put the countries of this world on notice that the sellout of the American worker was over.
322|We have slashed burdensome regulations, and imposed a policy that for each new regulation, two regulations must be erased from the books.
323|We've done it all while moving quickly to restore the most basic protection for all citizens, the rule of law?
324|A truly great judge, Neil Gorsuch, now sits on the United States Supreme Court. Justice Gorsuch is deeply devoted to our Constitution?
325|My Administration is the first in the modern political era to confirm a new Supreme Court Justice in the first 100 days 
326|the last time it happened was 136 years ago in 1881.
327|Defending the rule of law is a priority, not just in the courts, but also on the streets and on the border.
328|We've told the incredible police of our nation that they have our full support as they work to bring down violent crime rates?
329|We've taken bold action to go after criminal cartels, and made it a top priority to prosecute anyone who targets law enforcement.
330|This has been the work of my administration , fighting for the American worker, defending the rule of law, and returning the power to the American people.
331|Since my inauguration, economic confidence has soared,reaching higher than any time in 9 years.
332|Optimism among manufacturers is at a record high?
333|And small business confidence has seen its largest increase in nearly four decades?
334|Perhaps the greatest change of all is the renewal of the American Spirit?
335|As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, then the sun will always shine on our very Glorious Republic.
336|Since Day One, my administration has been hard at work, tearing down the barriers to job creation and economic growth.
337|We have removed one job-killing regulation after another , they're not pretty and they're going?
338|And believe me, we are just getting started on regulations. They're gone.
339|On Thursday, the House voted to repeal one of the worst job-killing laws of all.
340|?It' called ObamaCare, perhaps you've heard of it. Everywhere we look, ObamaCare is collapsing.
341|The House Bill is a plan that will save Americans from this disaster, and replace it with more choices, and more freedom for American families.
342|Most importantly, it will be great healthcare, and your premiums will come down, and your deductibles will come down?
343|So you'll have better healthcare at a lower cost.
344|And now, I'm calling on the Senate to take action. Repealing and replacing ObamaCare will be a big, big win for the American People.
345|Last week, my economic team outlined another step in our economic renewal: a massive tax cut to bring jobs and prosperity back to the USA?
346|We pay the highest taxes anywhere in the world. No country is higher, and we're bringing them down ,and I mean way down.
347|I am proposing,actually the single largest tax cut,in American history.
348|Our tax relief will be focused on the Middle Class, including much-needed relief for low and middle-income parents raising children.
349|As we provide tax relief to working families, we must also stop crippling American Industry?
350|Right now, America' businesses are taxed at the single highest rate in the developed world.
351|This is a self-inflicted economic wound that sends jobs to other countries.
352|?And believe me, before I got here, they were fleeing fast, but we've stopped it?
353|We want to turn our country into a jobs machine,a jobs magnet, something that really works again.
354|We want America to be the best place in the world to hire, grow, invest, and start a brand-new, beautiful business.
355|And that is why under our plan, we are cutting the business tax rate all the way down to 15 percent,
356|bringing thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores.
357|Today' high taxes on American Business are a gift to the foreign countries taking our jobs, factories, and wealth
358|and we're not going to allow it any longer?
359|Along with our historic tax cut we are proposing dramatic tax simplification?
360|American taxpayers spend billions of hours each year complying with our archaic tax laws, reducing economic productivity and job creation.
361|The complexity of the tax code also disadvantages small businesses and family-owned companies who can't afford to hire an army of lawyers,
362|?and that' what it is, it' an army of lawyers, and lobbyists, or accountants?
363|Other people can do it, you can't, and it' not fair to ask you to even think about it.
364|That is why we are cleaning up the code, streamlining deductions, and eliminating many special interest tax breaks that largely benefit only the wealthy.
365|Just weeks ago, millions of Americans filed their taxes on Tax Day,they were reminded again how much they give to Washington?
366|We believe every day Americans know better how to spend their own money than the federal bureaucracy,?
367|and we want to help them keep as much of that hard-earned money as we can.
368|Tax reform, along with regulatory relief and fair trade deals,and we're going to make them fair,but even really good again for our country,
369|and for our workers. All of this will usher in a new era of prosperity in America , and bring wealth, hope, and opportunity to those communities that need it the most.
370|Together, we are going to fight for every last American job. And we are going to fight for great, great trade deals that are so good for our workers, and so good for our families.
371|Confidence in the American economy has reached levels not seen in many, many years.
372|Unemployment fell to its lowest level in nearly ten years last month, and we created 211,000 new jobs.
373|Our economic progress is especially good news for the millions of young Americans
374| who, at this time of the year,?are putting on a cap and gown and receiving a diploma, certificate, or commission?
375|So important, and we are so proud of them.
376|This weekend, I am delighted to be participating first hand in the excitement by joining the students and faculty at Liberty University to celebrate the success of their graduates?
377|?I was invited to make the commencement address at West Point, but I will be away at the G7 , and I look forward to that , and will be at West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy.
378|Come to think about it, a few days later, I will actually travel to New London, Connecticut,
379|to speak to the graduating cadets of the United States Coast Guard Academy about their new roles serving our country.
380|?So we'll be with them very shortly.
381|To young Americans at both schools, I will be bringing a message of hope and optimism about our nation' bright future?
382|That is a message that I want to extend to all young Americans today, especially those who are graduating this year and entering the labor force.
383|We are also celebrating all of the Americans who learn the skills and trades that generations of workers have used to build, shape, and supply this nation.
384|The people who construct, repair, and create with their own two hands are the people who make this nation run.
385|And lots of those people voted for me.
386|That' also why, in my Administration, I am so deeply committed to technical and vocational education.
387|I want you to know that my administration is working every single day to create new opportunities?
388|?and to reverse years of stagnant growth, falling wages, and disappearing jobs.
389|We are ending the sellout of American workers,and lifting the burdens on American industry, manufacturing, and businesses.
390|We are rolling back the job-killing regulations that make it harder for companies to grow and hire in America?
391|At the same time, we are unleashing American energy development to create thousands of new jobs on our soil and just off our shores.
392|On trade, we have also taken historic action to protect American industry and bring back the kinds of high-paying jobs that can support a middle class family , and in fact, most families.
393|As a vote of confidence in these policies, business optimism is soaring and employment is rising?
394|These are great signs for America' future , the future that our new graduates will play with such a critical role in shaping our world and our country.
395|I want every young citizen , regardless of education or geography , to be able to live out their American Dreams.
396|So to all of America' graduates, congratulations. And to all of America' youth: we are here to help create the jobs and future you deserve.
397|The brightest days are ahead of you. And I just look forward to seeing you at the Coast Guard Academy, and at Liberty University.
398|This weekend I begin my first trip overseas as president , a trip with historic significance for the American people.
399|I will be visiting with the leaders in many different countries to strengthen our old friendships, build new partnerships, and unite the civilized world in a fight against terrorism.
400|In that spirit of unity, I will travel to lands associated with three of the world's great religions.
401|My first stop will be Saudi Arabia , the heart of the Muslim World.
402|There, I will address a historic gathering of the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations.
403|I will represent the views of the American people frankly and clearly.
404|Many of these leaders have expressed growing concern about terrorism, the spread of radicalization, and Iran's role in funding both?
405|Now it appears Muslim leaders are ready to take more responsibility and a much bigger role in fighting terrorism in their region?
406|?It' about time we do it, we'll do it together, but it has to be done.
407|America cannot solve all of the world's problems, but we can , and we must , help any nation willing to join in the common cause of eradicating terrorism from the face of the earth.
408|Next, I'll travel to the ancient city of Jerusalem to talk with my good friend, Prime Minister Netanyahu, about bringing peace and prosperity to both our nations.
409|Israel is an important American ally, but in recent years we haven't always treated them that way.
410|It's time to renew our friendship.
411|While I'm there, I'll also meet with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in Bethlehem to discuss ways to advance peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
412|From there, I'll head to the Vatican, where I will have the great honor of an audience with Pope Francis?
413|?I look forward to speaking with the Pope about how Christian teachings can help put the world on a path to justice, freedom, and peace.
414|I will also meet with friends and allies in Europe at a gathering of NATO in Brussels and at the G-7 Summit in Italy.
415|?Finally, I will close my trip by saying thank you to some of the courageous men and women of the United State Military serving their nation overseas.
416|In my Inaugural Address, I pledged to strengthen America's oldest friendships, to seek new partners in pursuit of peace, and above all , to always put American people first.
417|I also pledged that our partners must show that they're partners, they must show that they're friends,?
418|and they must contribute financially to the tremendous cost , the money that we're spending , is so big;?it' so much; and it' not fair for our nation?
419|They have to help and I'm sure they will. The fact is that I'm excited about new possibilities for peace and prosperity , and I hope you are too.
420|Each month families across the country work very, very hard to balance their budgets?
421|and to make the tough choices necessary to take care of their loved ones and to give their children opportunities they never had before?
422|This is who we are as Americans , we take pride in leaving each new generation a better country than the one we inherited.
423|Yet for decades, Washington has refused to make the tough choices.
424|?As a result, the American Dream has slipped from the grasp of more and more of our people.
425|This has to change.
426|We need a government that spends on the right things , the safety, security, and well-being of our people
427|?and stops the waste and abuse of taxpayer funds, whether in America or in global projects overseas , of which, perhaps, there are too many.
428|My administration is laying a new foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American Greatness.
429|The budget we are proposing will reverse economic stagnation and open the path to millions of new jobs for American workers.
430|We will balance the budget without making cuts in Social Security and Medicare?
431|We will achieve our goals by doing exactly what you do in your home: setting priorities, cutting the fat, and growing new opportunities?
432|?And the big thing for me is economic growth, which is not possible without safety and security?
433|We will grow our economy; it is growing already?
434|It will grow faster than you've seen it in decades?
435|That is why our budget reverses years of cuts to our military that have made us less safe in a more dangerous world?
436|We are going to make sure the men and women on the front lines of freedom have the tools they need to keep us safe and totally secure.
437|At home, we are going to give our ICE officers , who have done an incredible job
438|and our Border Patrol agents , who are amazing people , everything they need to end the lawlessness once and for all.
439|It is our moral duty to keep our citizens safe and free, and to protect the right of every American to pursue their dreams.
440|We don't want MS-13 roving our streets, we're getting rid of them by the thousands, they're going to be out of here.
441|But I'm proud to tell you that the first budget we are releasing provides a firm new foundation for the safety, and also for jobs and prosperity for all Americans in the years to come.
442|I am thrilled to be back in the United States after our first historic foreign trip.
443|Over the course of 9 days, Melania and I traveled to some of the holiest sites in the three Abrahamic religions and met with nearly 100 foreign leaders.
444|Everywhere we went, my goal was to advance American interests, to build a coalition of nations to drive out the terrorists
445|and to unlock a future of peace, prosperity, and hope for all Americans , and people around the world.
446|In Saudi Arabia, I was honored to participate in a historic summit with the leaders of more than 50 Muslim and Arab nations
447|where King Salman and many other leaders expressed their desire to take on a greater role in defeating terrorists who murder innocents of all faiths.
448|At this unprecedented summit, we opened a new center to combat extremist ideology, launched a task force to block funding for terrorists
449|and agreed to a massive economic development deal that will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the United States.
450|I also discussed the importance of the nations of the region taking more responsibility on migration
451|so that more young people are part of creating a better future in their home societies.
452|From Saudi Arabia, I traveled to Jerusalem, where I reaffirmed the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel?
453|There, I prayed at the Western Wall, visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and was awed by the majesty of that sacred land and the perseverance of the Jewish people.
454|I also traveled to Bethlehem, another ancient city of wonder, where I met with Palestinian leader President Abbas.
455|Both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu assured me they are ready to reach for peace.
456|From Israel, I traveled to Italy, where Melania and I were greatly honored to visit the Vatican and meet Pope Francis?
457|He was really wonderful , a great guy.
458|Then, I traveled to two summits with our key allies , first, the NATO Summit in Brussels
459|where nations agreed they must do more to meet their financial obligations and pay their fair share
460|?because right now, it is not fair to the United States. But it soon will be.
461|Next, I attended the G-7 Summit in Italy, where we worked to improve coordination on shared security threats,?
462|achieve more fair trade that gives workers a level playing field
463|and agreed on the goal that refugees should be resettled as close to their home countries as possible so they can be part of the future rebuilding.
464|Before we returned home, I was delighted to conclude my trip by visiting American military families , unbelievable people, the true source of our strength.
465|We will always protect those who protect us.
466|Our first foreign trip was full of historic and unprecedented achievements.
467|Joined by many old and new friends, we have paved the way for the new era of cooperation
468|?one that calls upon each nation to take more responsibility to bring peace to their people.
469|One that works together to defeat the scourge of terrorism and deliver hope to all of God' children.
470|And one that protects American interests so we remain a strong and prosperous nation
471|strong and prosperous, like never before , and a beacon of freedom and opportunity for many years to come.
472|This week, our nation was shocked and horrified when a gunman opened fire on a Member of Congress.
473|Five people were wounded in the assault, including a member of House Leadership , my good friend, Steve Scalise.
474|Steve is beloved across Washington, he embodies everything public service is about
475|he' dedicated to his constituents, devoted to his values, and deeply committed to his country.
476|I visited Steve, his wife, and his family in the hospital as he continues to fight for his recovery.
477|?435 Members of Congress, and 300 million Americans, are pulling for him, praying for him, and pledging to him our full and total support.
478|We continue to hold all of those wounded and fighting for recovery in our hearts and prayers, including Matt Mika, who was also badly wounded.
479|In that terrible crime, we also witnessed the incredible heroism of Capitol Police?
480|Special Agent Crystal Griner , who I also had the honor of meeting during my visit to the Hospital , raced into gunfire, along with Special Agent David Bailey.
481|They saved the lives of our Members of Congress and prevented that dark day from becoming a tragedy beyond imagination?
482|They, like so many other courageous police officers, represent the very best of us?
483|We salute them, and we also salute members of Alexandria Police, Fire and Rescue.
484|Though we have our differences, what unites us is so much stronger: our love of country, our devotion to its people.
485|Now more than ever, these values must guide us , and bring us closer together.
486|?Let us always remember that our job is to serve and represent the whole American People , and that we are all children of the same God.
487|This week, my Administration continues our focus on providing economic opportunity for all.
488|On Thursday, I signed an Executive Order to launch a groundbreaking new Apprenticeship Initiative?
489|?that will help young Americans learn the skills they need to find a rewarding career, earn a great living, and support themselves and their families.
490|We are celebrating the dignity of work and the greatness of the American Worker.
491|American citizens have worked every job, every occupation, no matter what it might be , no matter how grueling, how challenging, or even how dangerous.
492|?They wash the windows on our tallest skyscrapers; they create works of art from burning fire and molten steel;?
493|they mine the earth and dive the ocean depths to bring energy into our cities and towns;
494|?they care for the sick, the elderly, and the wounded; and they lay the bricks, mortar, rebar, and concrete that give us places to live, to work, and to thrive.
495|Today, this is the message I want every young American to hear: there is dignity in every honest job, and there is nobility in every honest worker.
496|Our Apprenticeship Initiative will make it dramatically easier for employers, industry groups and unions
497|to create exciting new apprenticeship programs that place students into high-paying careers.
498|Instead of being racked with crushing student debt, those who participate will earn while they learn , think of that: earn while they learn.
499|Under our plan, young Americans will have a pathway to exciting and fulfilling careers.
500|They will become brilliant technicians who revitalize American manufacturing.
501|They will become welders who forge from fire amazing works of iron and steel and art.
502|And they will become entrepreneurs who revolutionize entire industries.
503|And these striving American citizens, including millions of talented young American women with tremendous potential,?
504|will become the programmers who change the world with the next great technological advance.
505|Every American deserves a path to a great job that they truly love?
506|That begins with the right education , one that gives students the foundation for a lifetime of success.
507|Every day, as your President, I will be committed to this goal.508|And my Administration will use all available authorities to protect our great farmers.
509|And my Administration will use all available authorities to protect our great farmers.
510|We love our farmers, we're going to take care of our farmers.
511|We want fair and reciprocal trade – where countries open their markets in equal measure,
512|and all sides play by the rules.
513|And that hasn't been happening in the past.
514|What we won't tolerate are one-sided deals
515|where we open our markets while other countries close theirs.
516|Only by standing up for ourselves can we end the abuse,
517|restore our prosperity, and reclaim our economic independence.
518|We're going to make America wealthy again, not only great again.
519|Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.
520|They force the release of dangerous criminal aliens from prisons and jails, including drug traffickers and dealers, responsible for the deaths of countless Americans.
521|It's gotten totally out of control. We can't allow it to go on.
522|California's law also increases our vulnerability to terrorism by keeping life- saving information from federal authorities.
523|The relationship is ridiculous.
524|It forces law enforcement not to work together.
525|Last week, the citizens of Orange County, California bravely resisted the open-borders politicians in Sacramento.
526|The Orange County Board of Supervisors courageously voted to join the administration's lawsuit to stop these dangerous and unconstitutional actions.
527|Optimism is everywhere, enthusiasm is booming, and the thrilling American adventure has never looked brighter.
528|We are facing all challenges with new solutions and we're seizing new opportunities with brimming confidence and boundless resolve.
529|Because of you, your patriotism, your devotion, your love for your family,
530|we will be able to pass on the blessings of American liberty and prosperity to our children and our grandchildren.
531|Together, we're protecting our magnificent heritage, and reaching for glorious destiny.
532|Finally, Melania and I wanna wish every American a very happy new year.
533|Our country is great; our country is strong.
534|We're doing things nobody thought possible.
535|Thank you for giving me the opportunity to help. God bless you, and God bless America.
536|A single immigrant can begin a chain that could ultimately bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations.
537|Because these individuals are admitted solely on the basis of family ties – not skill or not merit
538|most of this immigration is lower-skilled, putting great strain on federal welfare.
539|And because there is no real selection criteria, the current system is totally incompatible with national security.
540|This week, a terrorist exploded a pipe bomb on a busy subway passage during rush hour in New York City, injuring innocent Americans.
541|This individual arrived through chain migration.
542|In October, another terrorist drove a truck into pedestrians and cyclists in New York City, killing 8 people and wounding many others.
543|That individual came through a visa lottery.
544|This order requires that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must -- and I mean must -- be eliminated.
545|It's out of control.
546|The January employment report shows that the private sector added 237,000 jobs last month.
547|A lot of that has to do with the spirit our country now has.
548|Job growth far surpassed expectations in January,
549|and the labor force participation also grew, so you can be encouraged about the progress of our economy.
550|It's going to be a whole new ball game.
551|But there is still much work to do. That I can tell you.
552|Also this week, on the first day of Black History Month, I was pleased to host African American leaders at the White House.
553|We are determined to deliver more opportunity, jobs and safety for the African-American citizens of our country.
554|America can really never, ever rest until children of every color are fully included in the American Dream -- so important.
555|My fellow Americans, one week ago, our administration assumed the enormous responsibilities that you, the American people have placed in us.
556|There is much work to do in the days ahead.
557|But I want to give you an update on what we have accomplished already.
558|In my first few days as your President, I met with the leaders of some our nation's top manufacturing companies and labor unions.
559|My message was clear: we want make things in America and we want use American workers.
560|Since my election, many companies have announce they are no longer moving jobs out of our country,
561|but are instead keeping and creating jobs right here in America.
562|Every day, we are fulfilling the promise we made to the American people.
563|Here are just a few of the executive actions that I have taken in the last few days
564|An order to prepare for repealing and replacing Obamacare, it's about time.
565|The withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership so that we can negotiate one-on-one deals that protect Americans workers.
566|That would have been a disastrous deal for our workers.
567|And the tools of craftsmen and the masons are just as important as the tools of the doctor and the dentist or the CEO,
568|or even the tools of politicians, believe it or not - and their work is every bit as noble.
569|They take pride in their jobs, and we take pride in them.
570|No longer will the concerns of these hardworking Americans go unanswered.
571|By making government answer to our citizens,
572|we are removing the limits on our future and setting free the dreams of our people.
573|As long as we do this, optimism will continue to soar.
574|Hope will continue to spring.
575|And this country we love will grow stronger and stronger day by day.
576|Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless America.
577|and to keep American workers and companies from being cheated out of contracts by countries
578|that break the rules and break every regulation in the book to take advantage of the United States.
579|That's not going to happen anymore.
580|I also took action to reform our immigration system so that it puts the needs of American workers first
581|the duty of government is to represent the citizens of the United States, and that is what we will do.
582|Whether it's removing job-killing regulations, protecting our borders, or unleashing American energy,
583|we are keeping our promises and delivering for the American Worker.
584|During my visit, I talked about how America is a nation that honors work.
585|We honor grit. We honor craftsmanship.
586|We honor the skilled trades people who turn rock and steel and iron and cement into works of art and grace and beauty.
587|There's tremendous talent there, believe me.
588|The wrench and ratchet are not only tools,
589|but instruments that help build cities out of deserts and send ships across the ocean.
590|For too long, American workers were forgotten by their government - and I mean totally forgotten.
591|Their interests were pushed aside for global projects,
592|and their wealth was taken from their communities and shipped across the world, all across the seas.
593|My Administration has offered a new vision. The well-being of the American citizen and worker will be placed second to none - and boy do I mean second to none.
594|Since Day One I have been fighting for the hardworking people of this country
595|and this week we took historic action to continue delivering on that promise.
596|We did so in one of the many proud industrial towns of our nation - Kenosha, Wisconsin
597|with the men and women of Snap-On, who make American tools for workers around the world.
598|They were there, and they loved what they heard, and they loved what they saw.
599|In Wisconsin, I signed an Executive Order to Buy American and Hire American.
600|I took historic action to ensure that Federal Projects are made with American Goods
601|Politicians responded to economic aggression with economic surrender.
602|Not anymore – it's not going to happen.
603|We're standing up for our families, our factory workers, and our way of life.
604|My Administration hears your voice – and has your back.
605|After a thorough investigation, my Administration documented China's unfair trade practices – including forced technology transfers.
606|As a result of this investigation, we're taking concrete actions to stop this abuse,
607|including proposing tariffs on select imports designed to save our industries for the future.
608|We have no other choice. We'll get along with China – they'll be friends of ours,
609|but they just can't take advantage of us any longer.
610|We will have a great relationship with China – but it will be a fair relationship, not like it was.
611|As a candidate for President, I promised that my Administration would fight every day for American Workers.
612|Years of unfair trade have hammered American families and plundered American wealth.
613|It's been absolutely terrible for our country.
614|We turned a blind eye while other nations targeted our industries and ransacked our factories.
615|They took advantage of our country.
616|They took advantage of our people.
617|Over the last two decades, the United States racked up $12.5 trillion dollar trade deficits in goods,
618|and watched nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs disappear or go to other countries.
619|We financed the rise of other countries at the expense of our own middle class people.
620|Yet our leaders in Washington did absolutely nothing.
621|They allowed other countries to cheat, to break the rules, and to steal our jobs with impunity.
622|My fellow Americans, at this holy time of the year, families across our nation gather in homes,
623|churches, and synagogues to light candles and to praise God.
624|During the sacred holiday of Passover, Jewish families around the world
625|give thanks to God for liberating the Jewish people from bondage in Egypt and delivering them to the Promised Land of Israel.
626|For Christians, we remember the suffering and death of God’s only son and his glorious resurrection on the third day.
627|On Easter Sunday, we proclaim with joy, Christ is risen.
628|Both of these sacred celebrations remind us that God's love redeems the world.
629|Almost 3,000 years ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote, Darkness covers the Earth,
630|but the Lord rises upon you, and his glory appears over you,
631|for the Lord will be your everlasting light.
632|In America, we look to the light of God to guide our steps,
633|we trust in the power of the Almighty for wisdom and strength,
634|and we praise our heavenly Father for blessings of freedom and the gift of eternal life.
635|Happy Passover, Happy Easter, thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.
636|remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.
637|Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.
638|That torch is now in our hands.
639|And we will use it to light up the world. 
640|I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
641|A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.  And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.
642|What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.  Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. 
643|In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our independence.
644|It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.  But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? 
645|I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.
646|For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. 
647|We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago
648|Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land.
649|We've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.
650| And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
651|Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. 
652|But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.
653|Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple
654|Because only then can we truly make America great again.
655|Dying industries will come roaring back to life.  Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.
656|Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.
657| Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.  
658| Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop.  And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.
659|Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. 
660|Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States
661|and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs
662|The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record.
663|We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic -- and it is a fantastic -- new F-35 jet fighter
664|We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials 
665|We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency. 
666|And we’re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. 
667|To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.
668|I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence
669|to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation. 
670|We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.
671|At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. 
672|help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. 
673|We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.  We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.
674|For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.  
675|we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.
676|Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.
677|To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question
678|What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?
679|protect, and defend the citizens of the United States.  We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism
680|According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.
681|We have seen the attacks at home -- from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.
682|We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world.  It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.
683|Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
684|We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America.  We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
685|and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those out who will do us harm. 
686|As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children 
687|Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.
688| I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.
689|Thank you, Maureen.  Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.
690|To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. 
691|He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination. 
692|Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. 
693|Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. 
694|Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.
695|More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working.  We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. 
696|In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.
697|We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
698|Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.
699|And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.
700|Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. 
701|It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. 
702|But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy 
703|making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.
704|Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.
705|My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
706|At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. 
707|But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing.
708|I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson.  
709| In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House
710|At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?  They said that it's good.  I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?
711|They told me -- without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it 
712|that it's very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. 
713|They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. 
714|They weren't even asking for a change.  But I am.
715|I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade.  It's been a long time since we had fair trade. 
716|The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government… will produce want and ruin among our people. 
717|Lincoln was right -- and it's time we heeded his advice and his words.
718|They have taken advantage of our country.  No longer.
719|Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.
720|Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon
721|According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.
722|Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system
723|we will have so many more benefits.  It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families -- including immigrant families -- enter the middle class.  And they will do it quickly
724|and they will be very, very happy, indeed. 
725|as long as we focus on the following goals:  To improve jobs and wages for Americans; to strengthen our nation's security
726|and to restore respect for our laws.  If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. 
727|initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program -- the building of the Interstate Highway System.  The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.
728|in the Middle East -- all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.  With this $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.
729|that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital -- creating millions of new jobs.
730|This effort will be guided by two core principles:  buy American and hire American.
731|Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.
732|Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. 
733|Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state -- the state of Kentucky -- and it's unsustainable and collapsing.
734|One-third of counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast.  They are losing them so fast.  They are leaving,
735|Americans have no choice at all.  There’s no choice left.  Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? 
736|We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.   Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect 
737|Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.  So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans
738|from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
739|through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts -- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them 
740|we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. 
741|Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance
742|and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down
743|And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines 
744|that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.  So important.
745|Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.
746|Every problem can be solved.  And every hurting family can find healing and hope.
747|Our citizens deserve this, and so much more -- so why not join forces 
748|and finally get the job done, and get it done right?
749|On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country
750|with members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable,
751| to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave 
752|and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.
753|True love for our people requires us to find common ground
754|to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.
755|An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all
756|Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. 757|My fellow Americans
758|One week ago, our administration assumed the enormous responsibilities that you, the American People, have placed in us.
759|There is much work to do in the days ahead, but I wanted to give you an update on what we have accomplished already.
760|In my first few days as your President
761|I've met with the leaders of some of our nation's top manufacturing companies and labor unions.
762|My message was clear: we want to make things in America, and we want to use American workers.
763|Since my election, many companies have announced they are no longer moving jobs out of our country 
764|but are instead keeping and creating jobs right here in America.
765|Every day, we are fulfilling the promise we made to the American People. 
766|Here are just a few of the executive actions that I have taken in the last few days 
767|An order to prepare for repealing and replacing Obamacare, it's about time.
768|The withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership
769|so that we can negotiate one-on-one deals that protect American workers. 
770|That would have been a disastrous deal for our workers.
771|An order to begin construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines
772|following a renegotiation of terms, with a requirement that pipelines installed in America 
773|be built with American steel and manufactured here.
774|A directive to expedite permits for new infrastructure and new manufacturing plants.
775|An order to immediately begin the border wall and to crack down on sanctuary cities. 
776|They are not safe, we have to take care of that horrible situation.
777|This administration has hit the ground running at a record pace, everybody is talking about it.
778|We are doing it with speed and we are doing it with intelligence
779|and we will never, ever stop fighting on behalf of the American People.
780|God bless you, and God Bless America.
781|This week I nominated Neil Gorsuch for the United States Supreme Court.
782|Judge Gorsuch is one of the most qualified people ever to be nominated for this post. 
783|He is a graduate of Columbia, Harvard and Oxford. He is a man of principle. He has an impeccable resume. 
784|He is widely respected by everyone. And, Judge Gorsuch's proven track record upholding the Constitution
785|makes him the ideal person to fill the vacancy left by the late, great Antonin Scalia, a truly fabulous justice. 
786|Ten years ago, the Senate unanimously approved Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
787|I urge members of both parties to support Judge Gorsuch and, in so doing, to protect our laws and our freedoms.
788|This week we also took significant action to roll back the massive regulation that is devastating our economy
789|and crippling American companies and jobs.
790|That's why I have issued a new executive order to create a permanent structure of regulatory reduction. 
791|This order requires that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must,and I mean must,be eliminated. It's out of control.
792|The January employment report shows that the private sector added
793|237,000 jobs last month. A lot of that has to do with the spirit our country now has.
794|Job growth far surpassed expectations in January, and the labor force participation also grew
795|so you can be encouraged about the progress of our economy. It's going to be a whole new ball game.
796|But there is still much work to do. That I can tell you.
797|Also this week, on the first day of Black History Month
798|I was pleased to host African American leaders at the White House. We are determined to deliver more opportunity, jobs and safety 
799|for the African-American citizens of our country. America can really never, ever rest
800|until children of every color are fully included in the American Dream,so important.I think, probably
801|one of my most and maybe my most important goal. It is our mutual duty and obligation to make sure this happens.
802|At Dover Air Force Base on Wednesday I joined the family of Chief Special Warfare Operator William "Ryan" Owens 
803|as our fallen hero was returned home. A great man. Chief Owens gave his life for his country and for our people. 
804|Our debt to him and his family, a beautiful family, is eternal. 
805|God has truly blessed this nation to have given us such a brave and selfless patriot as Ryan. We will never forget him. 
806|We will never ever forget those who serve. Believe me.
807|And I will never forget that my responsibility is to keep you,the American people,safe and free.
808|That's why last week I signed an executive order to help keep terrorists out of our country.
809|The executive order establishes a process to develop new vetting and mechanisms to ensure those coming into America 
810|love and support our people. That they have good intentions.
811|On every single front, we are working to deliver for American workers and American families. 
812|You, the law-abiding citizens of this country, are my total priority. Your safety, your jobs and your wages guide our decisions.
813|We are here to serve you, the great and loyal citizens of the United States of America. 
814|The forgotten men and women will be never be forgotten again. Because from now on, it's going to be America First. 
815|That's how I got elected, that's why you voted for me, and I will never forget it.
